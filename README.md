**Summer Research Undergraduate Project 2022 - AESO LTO EV Loading Analysis**

Repository will be a notebook backup for 2022 Summer Research,

Using AESO LTO and historical data will perform an analysis on EV loading forecasted against renewable generation for the same time periods.

Notebook analysis contains ability to modify from the base conditions, where:
- Renewable generation is consider to be used for non-EV charging uses.
- A percentage of annual compound additional renewable nameplate generation is considered.
- An EV load shifting of daily charging requirements off of peak hours.

Modifications are allowed within the Notebook using ipywidget iteractive slider bars.
